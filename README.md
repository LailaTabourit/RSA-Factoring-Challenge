# RSA Factoring Challenge

RSA-Factoring-Challenge is a repository dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of RSA encryption and decryption. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is the most widely used public-key cryptography algorithm globally, renowned for its robust security and versatility.

## Introduction

RSA is not just an encryption algorithm; it also serves as a foundation for digital signatures and key exchange. Developed in the 1970s by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, RSA revolutionized the field of cryptography by leveraging the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

## How RSA Works

RSA utilizes a public-key cryptosystem, employing two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key, known to everyone, is used for encryption, while the private key, held only by the owner, enables decryption. The asymmetric nature of RSA means that the encryption and decryption keys are distinct.

To generate RSA keys, two large prime numbers (p and q) are selected. The modulus (n) is calculated as the product of p and q. Additionally, the totient of n (φ(n)) is computed as (p-1)(q-1).

An integer e is chosen, satisfying the conditions 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1, where gcd(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b. This e is referred to as the public exponent and is used for encryption.

The final step is determining d such that ed = 1 mod φ(n). d, known as the private exponent, is used for decryption.

## Encryption and Decryption

With the RSA keys established, the message can be encrypted and decrypted. Encryption involves the computation of the ciphertext (c) using the following formula:

c = m^e mod n

Here, c represents the ciphertext, m denotes the message to be encrypted, and e is the public exponent.

To decrypt the ciphertext, the following formula is used:

m = c^d mod n

Here, m signifies the decrypted message, c represents the ciphertext, and d is the private exponent.
